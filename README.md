# 📊 Stack Overflow Developer Trends Analysis 

This project analyzes the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to uncover current and emerging technology trends in the software industry. It combines Python-based data wrangling and visualization with an interactive dashboard built using IBM Cognos Analytics.

## 🚀 Project Objective 
To help tech consulting firms and hiring managers make data-driven decisions by identifying:

+ Most-used programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks.

+ Technologies developers aspire to learn next.

+ Key developer demographics and job satisfaction insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies 
+ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

+ IBM Cognos Analytics – for building interactive, multi-tab dashboards.

+ Stack Overflow 2024 Survey Data – as the primary dataset.

## 📌 Dashboard Sections 
+ Current Technology Usage : Top 10 programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.

+ Future Technology Aspirations : Top desired technologies for the upcoming year.

+ Developer Demographics : Country-wise distribution, age groups, and education levels.

+ Job Insights : Industry domains, AI threat perception, job satisfaction levels.

## 🔍 Key Insights
+ JavaScript, Python, and SQL dominate developer usage; Rust and Go are gaining traction.

+ PostgreSQL and AWS are the most in-demand technologies across current and future usage.

+ Majority of developers (78.1%) do not see AI as a job threat.

+ Most developers rate their job satisfaction between 6–8/10.

+ 25–34-year-olds from USA, India, UK, and Germany make up the bulk of respondents.
